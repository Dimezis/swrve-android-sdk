Swrve SDK Advanced Push Notifications Sample
--------------------------------------------
Example of how to create an advanced UI for your push notifications, taking advantage of Android's latest features and Swrve's custom payloads for extra data.

This example extends and replaces the SwrveGcmIntentService to provide a big notification style and grouping or a custom XML layout for your notifications:
- [BigNotificationSwrveGcmIntentService](src/main/java/com/swrve/sdk/sample/BigNotificationSwrveGcmIntentService.java)
- [CustomLayoutSwrveGcmIntentService](src/main/java/com/swrve/sdk/sample/CustomLayoutSwrveGcmIntentService.java)
